This is your personal time tracker, a to-do list, and a glossary.

It can save your...

- **Tasks**. It helps you not to forget to do important things and learn how much time you’ve already spent on them.
- **Terms**. Your projects, the things you are interested in, places, books, music, and everything you want to save.
- **Time logs**. Each log is connected to a term from your glossary, divisions of activities (Visual, Audio, Code), and type of activities (Search, Planning, Implementation). There are some default divisions and types, but you can create yours and delete the ones you do not need.

Muthur shows time statistics and can **save all data** in an easy-to-use **JSON** format.

The app is in progress of improving the options of editing and data presentation.
